# 🎶🧠 **Brainwave Symphony: Compose Music with Your Mind** 🎶🧠

![Brainwave Symphony Banner](https://your-image-link-here.com/banner.png)

Welcome to **Brainwave Symphony**, a pioneering project that merges neuroscience with creative musical expression. This Python-based application lets you generate music directly from your brainwaves, allowing your thoughts, emotions, and mental states to shape a unique and evolving symphony.

---

## 🚀 **Features**

- 🎧 **Real-Time Brainwave Analysis:** Capture and analyze your brainwave data using an EEG headset.
- 🎼 **Emotion-to-Music Mapping:** Transform your mental state into dynamic, adaptive musical compositions.
- 🌌 **Interactive Soundscapes:** Experience an evolving soundscape that reacts to your brainwaves in real-time.
- 🎨 **Visual Feedback:** Enjoy synchronized visualizations that enhance your immersive experience.
- 🧘 **Meditative Mode:** Relax with guided music that adapts to optimize your relaxation.

---

## 🖥️ **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to set up and run **Brainwave Symphony** on your machine:

### 1. **Prerequisites**
- An EEG headset (e.g., Muse, OpenBCI)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

### 2. **Installation**

Clone this repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brainwave-symphony.git
cd brainwave-symphony
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Running the Application**

Start the application with the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Ensure your EEG headset is connected and properly calibrated. The application will guide you through the process of setting up the brainwave monitoring and music generation.

### 4. **Customization**

You can customize the music generation parameters by editing the configuration file (`config.yaml`). Options include adjusting the sensitivity of emotion-to-music mapping, changing the soundscape presets, and more.

---

## 🎛️ **Configuration**

The `config.yaml` file allows you to tweak various aspects of the Brainwave Symphony experience:

- **Music Sensitivity:** Control how responsive the music is to changes in your brainwaves.
- **Soundscapes:** Choose from different soundscapes or create your own.
- **Visualization Settings:** Adjust the visual feedback's colors, patterns, and intensity.
